# WebDAV

> WebDAV provider with PROPFIND listings and ranged downloads.

## Install

```bash
npm install @zero-transfer/webdav
```

Installing this package automatically pulls in [`@zero-transfer/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zero-transfer/core) as a transitive dependency. The full core surface (`createTransferClient`, `uploadFile`, `downloadFile`, profiles, errors, sync planner, …) is re-exported from this package, so a single `import { … } from "@zero-transfer/webdav"` is all you need. If your app uses multiple protocols, install the umbrella [`@zero-transfer/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zero-transfer/sdk) instead of multiple scoped packages.

## Overview
