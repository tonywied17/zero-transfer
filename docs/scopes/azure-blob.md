# Azure Blob

> Azure Blob Storage with SAS or AAD bearer auth.

## Install

```bash
npm install @zero-transfer/azure-blob
```

Installing this package automatically pulls in [`@zero-transfer/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zero-transfer/core) as a transitive dependency. The full core surface (`createTransferClient`, `uploadFile`, `downloadFile`, profiles, errors, sync planner, …) is re-exported from this package, so a single `import { … } from "@zero-transfer/azure-blob"` is all you need. If your app uses multiple protocols, install the umbrella [`@zero-transfer/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zero-transfer/sdk) instead of multiple scoped packages.

## Overview

Azure Blob Storage provider - SAS-token or AAD bearer auth, container-scoped paginated listings, HEAD-based stat, ranged downloads, and single-shot block-blob uploads. Wire OAuth refresh via `createOAuthTokenSecretSource()`.
