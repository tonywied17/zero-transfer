# Dropbox

> Dropbox provider with content-hash verification.

## Install

```bash
npm install @zero-transfer/dropbox
```

Installing this package automatically pulls in [`@zero-transfer/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zero-transfer/core) as a transitive dependency. The full core surface (`createTransferClient`, `uploadFile`, `downloadFile`, profiles, errors, sync planner, …) is re-exported from this package, so a single `import { … } from "@zero-transfer/dropbox"` is all you need. If your app uses multiple protocols, install the umbrella [`@zero-transfer/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zero-transfer/sdk) instead of multiple scoped packages.

## Overview

Dropbox provider - RPC + content-host APIs, list-folder cursor pagination, ranged downloads, single-shot uploads in `overwrite` mode, and `content_hash` exposed as both `uniqueId` and `checksum`.

## Public surface
