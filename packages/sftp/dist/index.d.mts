 * Creates a {@link ProviderFactory} backed by the native SSH/SFTP protocol

 *
 * **Supported algorithms**
 * - Key exchange: `curve25519-sha256`, `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org`
 * - Host keys: `ssh-ed25519`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256/384/521`, `rsa-sha2-256`,
 *   `rsa-sha2-512` (legacy SHA-1 `ssh-rsa` is rejected)
 * - Ciphers: `aes128-ctr`, `aes256-ctr`
 * - MACs: `hmac-sha2-256`, `hmac-sha2-512`
 *
 * **Authentication**
 * - `password`
 * - `keyboard-interactive` (RFC 4256)
 * - `publickey` for Ed25519 and RSA private keys (`rsa-sha2-512` preferred,
 *   `rsa-sha2-256` fallback). Encrypted keys are unlocked via
 *   `profile.ssh.passphrase`.
 *
 * **Host-key verification**
 * - The server's signature over the exchange hash is always verified.
 * - Optional pinning via `profile.ssh.pinnedHostKeySha256` (`SHA256:...`,
 *   raw base64, or hex).
 * - Optional `profile.ssh.knownHosts` (OpenSSH format, hashed and plain
 *   patterns, `[host]:port`, negation, and `@revoked` markers).
 *
 * **Resilience**
 * - `readyTimeoutMs` bounds TCP connect + SSH handshake.
 * - `keepaliveIntervalMs` keeps idle sessions alive through stateful
 *   firewalls / NAT.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const client = createTransferClient({
 *   providers: [createNativeSftpProviderFactory({
 *     readyTimeoutMs: 10_000,
 *     keepaliveIntervalMs: 30_000,
 *   })],
 * });
 * const session = await client.connect({
 *   provider: "sftp",
 *   host: "sftp.example.com",
 *   username: "deploy",
 *   ssh: {
 *     privateKey: { kind: "literal", value: process.env.DEPLOY_KEY! },
 *     pinnedHostKeySha256: "SHA256:abc...",
 *   },
 * });
