title: Capability matrix
description: What each provider can and can't do - streaming, resume, server-side copy, multipart upload, checksum exposure.
---

Every provider advertises its own [`CapabilitySet`](../../api/interfaces/capabilityset/). The full programmatic matrix is exposed via [`getBuiltinCapabilityMatrix()`](../../api/functions/getbuiltincapabilitymatrix/) and renders to Markdown via [`formatCapabilityMatrixMarkdown()`](../../api/functions/formatcapabilitymatrixmarkdown/).

For a live, type-safe view at runtime:

```ts
import { getBuiltinCapabilityMatrix } from "@zero-transfer/sdk";

const matrix = getBuiltinCapabilityMatrix();
console.table(matrix);
```

Operations branch on capabilities at runtime - for example, `copyBetween()` will use server-side copy when both ends support it on the same provider, falling back to a streaming copy otherwise. You don't have to special-case providers in your own code.
