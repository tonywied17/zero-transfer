/**
 * @file FTPS client-certificate (mutual TLS) example with certificate pinning.
 *
 * This is the **production-hardened** form: mTLS with a private CA bundle and a
 * SHA-256 server-cert pin. For the minimal connect-only form against a
 * public-CA endpoint, see `ftps-basic.ts`.
 *
 * `tls.cert` + `tls.key` are required only when the server demands client
 * certificates (mTLS). `tls.ca` is required only for private/internal CAs.
 * `tls.pinnedFingerprint256` is **optional but recommended** as defence in
 * depth against rogue certificates issued by an otherwise-trusted CA.
