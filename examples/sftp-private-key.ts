/**
 * @file SFTP private-key authentication example with host-key pinning.
 *
 * This is the **production-hardened** form: public-key auth + a SHA-256 host-key
 * pin. For the minimal connect-only form, see `sftp-basic.ts`.
 *
 * `ssh.privateKey` is required for key-based auth. `ssh.pinnedHostKeySha256` is
 * **optional but strongly recommended** - without it (or `ssh.knownHosts`) the
 * SSH session does not verify the server's host key.
