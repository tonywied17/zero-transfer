/**
 * @file Basic FTP upload + download example.
 *
 * The simplest possible end-to-end FTP flow: connect with username/password,
 * upload a single local file with `uploadFile`, then download it back to a
 * different local path with `downloadFile`. Useful as a starting point before
 * layering in TLS (`ftps-client-certificate`), SSH (`sftp-private-key`), or
 * scheduled MFT routes (`mft-route`).
